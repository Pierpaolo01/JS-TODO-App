## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript


### What I learned

This was a great project to refresh my Javascript skills, I explicitly chose to stick with Vanilla JS rahter then a framework in order to regrasp it's core concepts.  

I learned responsive web design by using mobile-first deisgn workflow, using CSS @Media queries to re-style the content at pre-determined screen sizes.
With JS I learned alot about DOM manipulation and JS can interact with the HTML, although other JS frameworks make it much easier to interact with the DOM sticking with Vanilla JS it re-enforced the core conecpts that JS language has to offer.


### Continued development

Since I used this project to refresh my javascript skills after a prolonged period, there are a handfull of things I would like to itterate, such as streamling my code more to fit the latest 'best-practices' and using more of the latest feaures of ES6, like arrow functions. 
I also did not get the opportunity to practice more advaced conecpts that JS has to offer like recursive functions.

I did get the chance to experiment with closures, and the lexical scope of variables within functions.
